# starter-bot-slack
Simple slack bot to start with, and later adding mor functionality ongoing (SQLite, Twilio, API.ai, etc.)

##Tools You Need to run it

My bot, I named "StarterBot", requires Python and the Slack API. To run my Python code you need:

- Either Python 2 or 3
- pip and virtualenv to handle Python application dependencies
- Free Slack account with a team on which you have API access or sign up for the Slack Developer Hangout team
- Official Python slackclient code library built by the Slack team
- Slack API testing token

It is also useful to have the Slack API docs handy.

A common practice for Python developers is to export secret tokens as environment variables, so I did as well during the creation.
